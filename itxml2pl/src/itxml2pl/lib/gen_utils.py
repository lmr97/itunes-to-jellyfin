    Here are the options parsed for, and their descriptions

    -x, --library-xml XMLFILE
                      Filepath to Library.xml. Assumed to be in working directory if omitted. 

    -m, --music-dir SVR_MUSIC_DIR
                      Filepath to the directory where iTunes audio files are stored on
                      the server, added to make paths to tracks absolute. If omitted, all paths will 
                      be relative.

    -p, --playlist-dir PLAYLIST_DIR
                      The directory where you would like your playlist files stored. It will be 
                      created if it does not exist. If omitted, a directory named "Playlists" 
                      will be created in the working directory (if necessary) and filled with 
                      the playlist files. 
                      

    -c, --check-exists {warn, error, none}
                      Check if song file at inferred path exists, and either warn or throw an 
                      error. `none` only count if the file was not found, but add it to the playlist
                      file anyway. Default: warn. Set to `none` if -m is absent. (cannot check path 
                      reliably). 

    -f, --format {m3u, xml}
                      The format to output the playlists info into. Defaults to XML. If `xml`
                      is chosen, the file will be formatted like Jellyfin's playlist XMLs,
                      but with <RunningTime>, <Genres>, and <OwnerUserID> tags omitted, as they
                      can be filled in with a rescan of the library (this will be relatively
                      brief if the music has been scanned already).    

    -w                Use MSDOS (Windows) filepath conventions (backslash file separator).

    --debug           Don't catch any errors, allow Python to crash so it will display the 
                      stack trace.

    -t, --ext-map     Show mapping of file types to file extensions used in the program and exit.

    -h, --help        Display this help info and exit. (-h is added in ArgumentParser by default)
